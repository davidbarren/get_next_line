# get_next_line
The goal of this project was to create a function that could read from a file and return it line by line.
The only difference between the "get_next_line.c" and "get_next_line_bonus.c" files is the bonus has the ability to read from multiple file descriptors simultaneously. Each file should be compiled with its respective "_utils" file. (This file was created to limit the amount of functions in each file to a maximum of 5)
